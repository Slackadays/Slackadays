Hi! I'm Jackson Huff, AKA Slackadays. I'm a 19 year old student at the University of Central Florida studying Optics & Photonics Engineering and Leadership. 

I started programming when I was 8 by reading this thick and heavy "C++11 Primer" textbook cover to cover. Since then, I've been trying to make people's lives better by making super useful tools that are a pleasure to use.
