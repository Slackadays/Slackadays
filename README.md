Hi! I'm Jackson Huff, and I'm a 20 year old student at the University of Central Florida studying Optics & Photonics Engineering and Leadership. 

I started programming when I was 8 by reading this obscenely thick and heavy "C++11 Primer" textbook cover to cover. Since then, my goal has been to make your life better by crafting gorgeous yet super useful tools.
